Introduction
Categories such as animal or furniture are fundamental cognitive building blocks allowing humans to efficiently represent and communicate the complex world around them. Concepts (e.g., dog, table) are grouped into categories based on shared properties pertaining, for example, to their behavior, appearance, or function. Categorization underlies other cognitive functions such as perception BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 or language BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , and there is evidence that categories are not only shaped by the world they represent, but also by the language through which they are communicated BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 . Although mental categories exist across communities and cultures, their exact manifestations differ BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 . For example, American English speakers prefer taxonomic categorizations (e.g., mouse,squirrel) while Chinese speakers tend to prefer to categorize objects relationally (e.g., tree, squirrel; BIBREF7 ). Given their prevalent function in human cognition, the acquisition and representation of categories has attracted considerable attention in cognitive science, and numerous theories have emerged BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . Empirical studies of category acquisition and representation, have been predominantly based on small-scale laboratory experiments. In a typical experiment, human subjects are presented with small sets of often artificial concepts, such as binary strings BIBREF14 or colored shapes BIBREF15 , with strictly controlled features BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . Hypotheses and principles of human categorization are established based on the processes and characteristics of the categorizations produced by the participants.

Introduction
Deep learning models have been widely used in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. A major challenge is how to design and learn the semantic composition function while modeling a text sequence. The typical composition models involve sequential BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , convolutional BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 and syntactic BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 compositional models. In spite of their success, these models have two major limitations. First, they usually use a shared composition function for all kinds of semantic compositions, even though the compositions have different characteristics in nature. For example, the composition of the adjective and the noun differs significantly from the composition of the verb and the noun. Second, different composition functions are learned from scratch in different tasks. However, given a certain natural language, its composition functions should be the same (on meta-knowledge level at least), even if the tasks are different. To address these problems, we need to design a dynamic composition function which can vary with different positions and contexts in a sequence, and share it across the different tasks. To share some meta-knowledge of composition function, we can adopt the multi-task learning BIBREF8 . However, the sharing scheme of most neural multi-task learning methods is feature-level sharing, where a subspace of the feature space is shared across all the tasks. Although these sharing schemes are successfully used in various NLP tasks BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , they are not suitable to share the composition function. In this paper, inspired by recent work on dynamic parameter generation BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , we propose a function-level sharing scheme for multi-task learning, in which a shared meta-network is used to learn the meta-knowledge of semantic composition among the different tasks. The task-specific semantic composition function is generated by the meta-network. Then the task-specific composition function is used to obtain the task-specific representation of a text sequence. The difference between two sharing schemes is shown in Figure 1 . Specifically, we use two LSTMs as meta and basic (task-specific) network respectively. The meta LSTM is shared for all the tasks. The parameters of the basic LSTM are generated based on the current context by the meta LSTM, therefore the composition function is not only task-specific but also position

Introduction
Human thinking is regarded as ‘mental ideas flow guided by language to achieve a goal’. For instance, after seeing heavy rain, you may say internally ‘holding an umbrella could avoid getting wet’, and then you will take an umbrella before leaving. In the process, we know that the visual input of ‘water drop’ is called rain, and can imagine ‘holding an umbrella’ could keep off the rain, and can even experience the feeling of being wet. This continual thinking capacity distinguishes us from the machine, even though the latter can also recognize images, process language, and sense rain-drops. Continual thinking requires the capacity to generate mental imagination guided by language, and extract language representations from a real or imagined scenario. Modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques can handle question answering etc. tasks, such as answering that ‘Cao Cao’s nickname is Meng De’ based on the website knowledge [1]. However, the NLP network is just a probability model [2] and does not know whether Cao Cao is a man or cat. Indeed, it even does not understand what is a man. On the other hand, human being learns Cao Cao with his nickname via watching TV. When presented the question ‘what’s Cao Cao’s nickname?’, we can give the correct answer of ‘Meng De’ while imagining the figure of an actor in the brain. In this way, we say the machine network does not understand it, but the human does. Human beings possess such thinking capacity due to its cumulative learning capacity accompanying the neural developmental process. Initially, parent points to a real apple and teaches the baby ‘this is an apple’. After gradually assimilating the basic meanings of numerous nouns, children begin to learn some phrases and finally complicated syntaxes. Unlike the cumulative learning, most NLP techniques normally choose to learn by reading and predicting target words. After consuming billions of words in corpus materials [2], the NLP network can predict ‘Trump’ following ‘Donald’, but it is merely a probability machine. The human-like thinking system often requires specific neural substrates to support the corresponding functionalities. The most important brain area related to thinking is the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where the working memory takes place, including but not confined to, the maintenance and manipulation of particular information [3]. With the PFC, human beings can analyze and execute various tasks via ‘phonological loop’ and ‘visuospatia

Introduction
Human learning occurs through interaction BIBREF0 and multimodal experience BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . Prior work has argued that machine learning may also benefit from interactive, multimodal learning BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , termed virtual embodiment BIBREF6 . Driven by breakthroughs in static, unimodal tasks such as image classification BIBREF7 and language processing BIBREF8 , machine learning has moved in this direction. Recent tasks such as visual question answering BIBREF9 , image captioning BIBREF10 , and audio-video classification BIBREF11 make steps towards learning from multiple modalities but lack the dynamic, responsive signal from exploratory learning. Modern, challenging tasks incorporating interaction, such as Atari BIBREF12 and Go BIBREF13 , push agents to learn complex strategies through trial-and-error but miss information-rich connections across vision, language, sounds, and actions. To remedy these shortcomings, subsequent work introduces tasks that are both multimodal and interactive, successfully training virtually embodied agents that, for example, ground language in actions and visual percepts in 3D worlds BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF14 . For virtual embodiment to reach its full potential, though, agents should be immersed in a rich, lifelike context as humans are. Agents may then learn to ground concepts not only in various modalities but also in relationships to other concepts, i.e. that forks are often in kitchens, which are near living rooms, which contain sofas, etc. Humans learn by concept-to-concept association, as shown in child learning psychology BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , cognitive science BIBREF15 , neuroscience BIBREF16 , and linguistics BIBREF17 .

Introduction
The ability to continuously learn and accumulate knowledge throughout a lifetime and reuse it effectively to adapt to a new problem quickly is a hallmark of general intelligence. State-of-the-art machine learning models work well on a single dataset given enough training examples, but they often fail to isolate and reuse previously acquired knowledge when the data distribution shifts (e.g., when presented with a new dataset)—a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 . The three main approaches to address catastrophic forgetting are based on: (i) augmenting the loss function that is being minimized during training with extra terms (e.g., a regularization term, an optimization constraint) to prevent model parameters learned on a new dataset from significantly deviating from parameters learned on previously seen datasets BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , (ii) adding extra learning phases such as a knowledge distillation phase, an experience replay BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , and (iii) augmenting the model with an episodic memory module BIBREF7 . Recent methods have shown that these approaches can be combined—e.g., by defining optimization constraints using samples from the episodic memory BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 . In language learning, progress in unsupervised pretraining BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 has driven advances in many language understanding tasks BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 . However, these models have been shown to require a lot of in-domain training examples, rapidly overfit to particular datasets, and are prone to catastrophic forgetting BIBREF15 , making them unsuitable as a model of general linguistic intelligence. In this paper, we investigate the role of episodic memory for learning a model of language in a lifelong setup. We propose to use such a component for sparse experience replay and local adaptation to allow the model to continually learn from examples drawn from different data distributions. In experience replay, we randomly select examples from memory to retrain on. Our model only performs experience replay very sparsely to consolidate newly acquired knowledge with existing knowledge in the memory into the model. We show that a 1% experience replay to learning new examples ratio is sufficient. Such a process bears some similarity to memory consolidation in human learning BIBREF16 . In local adaptation, we follow Memory-based Parameter Adaptation BIBREF7 and use examples retrieved from memory to update model parameters use

Introduction
Since the introduction of the personality concept, psychologists have worked to formulate theories and create models describing human personality and reliable measure to accordingly. The filed has been successful to bring forth a number of robust models with corresponding measures. One of the most widely accepted and used is the Five Factor Model BIBREF0. The model describes human personality by five traits/factors, popularly referred to as the Big Five or OCEAN: Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and emotional stability (henceforth Stability). There is now an extensive body of research showing that these factors matter in a large number of domains of people’s life. Specifically, the Big Five factors have been found to predict life outcomes such as health, longevity, work performance, interpersonal relations, migration and social attitudes, just to mention some domains (e.g. BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4).To date, the most common assessment of personality is by self-report questionnaires BIBREF5. In the past decade however, personality psychologist, together with computer scientist, have worked hard to solve the puzzle of extracting a personality profile (e.g., the Big Five factors) of an individual based on a combination of social media activities BIBREF6. However, in the aftermath of Cambridge Analytica scandal, where the privacy of millions of Facebook users was violated, this line of research has been met with skepticism and suspicion. More recent research focuses on text from a variety of sources, including twitter data (e.g. BIBREF7, BIBREF8). Recent development in text analysis, machine learning, and natural language models, have move the field into an era of optimism, like never before. Importantly, the basic idea in this research is that personality is reflected in the way people write and that written communication includes information about the author’s personality characteristics BIBREF9. Nevertheless, while a number of attempts has been made to extract personality from text (see below), the research is standing remarkably far from reality. There are, to our knowledge, very few attempts to test machine learning models “in the wild”. The present paper aims to deal with this concern. Specifically, we aim to (A) create a model which is able to extract Big Five personality from a text using machine learning techniques, (B) investigate whether a model trained on a large amount of solo-annotated

Introduction
Affect is a term that subsumes emotion and longer term constructs such as mood and personality and refers to the experience of feeling or emotion BIBREF0 . BIBREF1 picard1997affective provides a detailed discussion of the importance of affect analysis in human communication and interaction. Within this context the analysis of human affect from text is an important topic in natural language understanding, examples of which include sentiment analysis from Twitter BIBREF2 , affect analysis from poetry BIBREF3 and studies of correlation between function words and social/psychological processes BIBREF4 . People exchange verbal messages which not only contain syntactic information, but also information conveying their mental and emotional states. Examples include the use of emotionally colored words (such as furious and joy) and swear words. The automated processing of affect in human verbal communication is of great importance to understanding spoken language systems, particularly for emerging applications such as dialogue systems and conversational agents. Statistical language modeling is an integral component of speech recognition systems, with other applications such as machine translation and information retrieval. There has been a resurgence of research effort in recurrent neural networks for language modeling BIBREF5 , which have yielded performances far superior to baseline language models based on n-gram approaches. However, there has not been much effort in building neural language models of text that leverage affective information. Current literature on deep learning for language understanding focuses mainly on representations based on word semantics BIBREF6 , encoder-decoder models for sentence representations BIBREF7 , language modeling integrated with symbolic knowledge BIBREF8 and neural caption generation BIBREF9 , but to the best of our knowledge there has been no work on augmenting neural language modeling with affective information, or on data-driven approaches to generate emotional text. Motivated by these advances in neural language modeling and affective analysis of text, in this paper we propose a model for representation and generation of emotional text, which we call the Affect-LM.

Inner Reality Unveiled

There is no direct (literal) view of the actual reality 'out there'. Our inner viewport is ever only that of the model (qualia) of inner and outer reality built by the brain. We see/sense nothing but this model made inside the brain.
We don't see across a room or any scene but only across the model of the room/scene. We don't look through a microscope at an actual object but only look at a model of that object. You get the idea. A reflective color spectrum is used to make it look like that more distinctive color is a surface property of an object modeled.
The brain doesn't model everything, as a lot of it would be clutter, and for what remains as useful to portray the brain still doesn't have the resources to model everything at high resolution and so thus whatever we focus on gets all the high res detail put into it just in the nick of time when we look/focus. At dawn or dusk this high resolution becomes a bit less on what we focus on so that what's off to the left or right can be better noted in the dim light.
So far, nothing astounding here to us, although maybe to everyday folk that we only ever see the inside of the head/brain—the model.
Of course, the shocks get worse, such as that our intentions cannot be those of first cause, self-made people, but from prior causes that we weren't able to choose and be responsible for. What is left, in short, is the freedom of action for these inbuilt intentions to operate, at least when not prevented by the weather or any other controlling factors, which 'freedom of action' amounts to compatibilism.
Other notes on the above are that while we can never know if everything is deterministic, although we know that a lot is, whatever is indeterminate diminishes our modeling and our consistency.
Re: Inner Reality Unveiled

To continue, many feel that the model/qualia is very rich, but there's not anything to compare it to. Some creatures have a fourth primary color to work from and some have more smells and better hearing. Our colors (reflective spectrum) go through some averaging because of the various close frequencies about, but they still have a lot of pop to them. The model seems to be super real, where it has the focused detail, meaning better than real, or super real or surreal; surely colors win out over a bunch of waves (if they could be seen), these colors being very distinctive, wh

I was taught by learning how to solve problems in a language agnostic way using flowcharts and [PDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Design_Language) (Program Design Language). After a couple weeks of that, I learned to convert the PDL I had written to a language. I am glad I learned that way because I have spent the majority of my years programming, solving problems without being tied to a language. What language I use has always been an implementation detail and not part of the design. 

 Having to solve the problem by breaking it down into it's basic steps is a key skill. I think it is one of the things that separates those that can program from those that can't.

 As far as how you tackle the order of concepts of a language I believe the easiest way is to decide that is to have a project in mind and tackle the concepts as they are needed. This lets you apply them as they are needed on something that you are interested in doing. When learning a language it is good to have several simple projects in mind and a few with progressive complexity. Deciding on those will help you map out the concepts that are needed and their order.

Grad F: I 'm {disfmarker} What ? Really ? Oh , that 's horrible ! Disincentive !
Grad A: OK , we 're recording .
Grad F: Hello ?
Grad B: Check check {pause} check check .
Grad D: Uh , yeah .
Grad F: Hello ? Which am I ?
Professor C: Oh right .
Grad B: Alright . Good .
Grad F: Channel fi OK . OK . Are you doing something ? OK , then I guess I 'm doing something . So , um , So basically the result of m much thinking since the last time we met , um , but not as much writing , um , is a sheet that I have a lot of , like , thoughts and justification of comments on but I 'll just pass out as is right now . So , um , here . If you could pass this around ? And there 's two things . And so one on one side is {disfmarker} on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification .
Grad D: Um {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} wait .
Grad F: And the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism .
Grad E: This is just one sheet , right ?
Grad D: Ah ! Just one sheet .
Grad F: It 's just one sheet .
Grad D: OK .
Grad F: It 's just a {disfmarker} Nothing else .
Grad D: Front , back .
Grad F: Um , Enough to go around ? OK . And in some ways it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's very similar to {disfmarker} There are very few changes in some ways from what we 've , um , uh , b done before but I don't think everyone here has seen all of this . So , uh , I 'm not sure where to begin . Um , as usual the disclaimers are there are {disfmarker} all these things are {disfmarker} it 's only slightly more stable than it was before .
Grad E: Mm - hmm .
Grad F: And , um , after a little bit more discussion and especially like Keith and I {disfmarker} I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days , um , it 'll probably change again some more .
Grad E: Yeah .
Grad F: Um , maybe I will {disfmarker} let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation , um , because that 's , I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um {disfmarker} to people . OK , so the top block is just sort of a {disfmarker} sort of abstract nota it 's sort of like , um , listings of the kinds of things that we can have . And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this . There {disfmarker} there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth . But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name . I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line

The best way to learn anything is to start with the basic. You can find any good text book to explain what programming is, memory, algorithms. 

 The next step select the language which it just depends on what the teacher knows or why the student wants to learn. 

 Then it is just code, code, code. Code every example right from the book. Then change it slightly to do another action. Learning to program is an active process not a passive one. You can't just read C++ How to Program by Dietal and then expect to code C++ without having actively done it while reading.

 Even if you are an experienced coder it helps to write the code in the book to learn something new.

Introduction and background
Recent years have witnessed increased performance in many computational linguistics tasks such as syntactic and semantic parsing BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , emotion classification BIBREF2 , and sentiment analysis BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , especially concerning the applicability of such tools to noisy online data. Moreover, the field has made substantial progress in developing multilingual models and extending semantic annotation resources to languages beyond English BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 . Concurrently, it has been argued for mental health research that it would constitute a `valuable critical step' BIBREF10 to analyse first-hand accounts by individuals with lived experience of severe mental health issues in blog posts, tweets, and discussion forums. Several severe mental health difficulties, e.g., bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia are considered as chronic and clinical recovery, defined as being relapse and symptom free for a sustained period of time BIBREF11 , is considered difficult to achieve BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 . Moreover, clinically recovered individuals often do not regain full social and educational/vocational functioning BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 . Therefore, research originating from initiatives by people with lived experience of mental health issues has been advocating emphasis on the individual's goals in recovery BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . This movement gave rise to the concept of personal recovery BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , loosely defined as a `way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and contributing life even with limitations caused by illness' BIBREF18 . The aspects of personal recovery have been conceptualised in various ways BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . According to the frequently used CHIME model BIBREF24 , its main components are Connectedness, Hope and optimism, Identity, Meaning and purpose, and Empowerment. Here, we focus on BD, which is characterised by recurring episodes of depressed and elated (hypomanic or manic) mood BIBREF25 , BIBREF12 . Bipolar spectrum disorders were estimated to affect approximately 2% of the UK population BIBREF13 with rates ranging from 0.1%-4.4% across 11 other European, American and Asian countries BIBREF26 . Moreover, BD is associated with a high risk of suicide BIBREF27 , making its prevention and treatment important tasks for society. BD-specific personal recovery research is motivated by mainly two facts: First, the pole of positive/elevated mood and ongoin

It really depends on your brother's learning style. Many people learn faster by getting their hands dirty & just getting into it, crystallising the concepts and the big picture as they progress and build their knowledge.

 Me, I prefer to start with the big picture and drill down into the nitty-gritty. The first thing I wanted to know was how it all fits together then all that Object-oriented gobbledygook, then about classes & instances and so-on. I like to know the underlying concepts and a bit of theory before I learn the syntax. I had a bit of an advantage because I wrote some games in BASIC 20 years ago but nothing much since.

 Perhaps it is useful to shadow a production process by starting with an overall mission statement, then a plan and/or flowchart, then elaborate into some pseudo code (leaning towards the syntax you will ultimately use) before actually writing the code.

 The golden rule here is to suss out your student's leaning style.

This may sound dumb, but why are YOU trying to teach your brother to program?

 Often the best learning environment consists of an goal that can be achieved by a keen beginner (a sample program), an ample supply of resources (google/tutorials/books), and a knowledgeable source of advice that can provide guidance when needed.

 You can definitely help with suggestions for the first two, but the last is your primary role.

If you like programming you should learn Lisp for the pure joy of it. [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/224/) perfectly expresses the intellectual enlightenment that ensues. Learning Lisp is for the programmer what meditation is for the Buddhist monk (and I meant this without any blasphemous connotation).
